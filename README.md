# Bank Transaction Data Categorization with Llama2

**Description:**

This project investigates the use of a locally deployed Llama2 model for automated categorization of personal bank transaction data. The goal is to streamline data analysis and gain deeper insights into spending habits by leveraging the power of large language models.

**Key Features:**

* Automated Categorization
* Improved Data Analysis
* Enhanced Data Management
* Local Deployment

**Technical Details:**

* **Model:** Llama2 
* **Deployment:** [Specify your deployment method, e.g., Docker, virtual environment]
* **Data Preprocessing:** [Describe any data preprocessing steps, e.g., cleaning, formatting]
* **Evaluation:** [Explain how you evaluated the model's performance, e.g., accuracy metrics, confusion matrices] 

**Usage:**

1. **Data Preparation:** 
    * Prepare your bank transaction data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    * Ensure data privacy and security by anonymizing any sensitive information.
2. **Model Deployment:** 
    * Deploy the Llama2 model locally according to the instructions in the deployment section.
3. **Run Categorization:** 
    * Feed your transaction data to the deployed model.
    * The model will automatically categorize each transaction.
4. **Analyze Results:** 
    * Analyze the categorized data to gain insights into your spending habits.
    * Use the results to improve your budgeting and financial decision-making.

**Future Work:**

* Explore alternative LLMs for improved performance.
* Implement more sophisticated data preprocessing techniques.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
* Integrate the model into a personal finance management tool.
