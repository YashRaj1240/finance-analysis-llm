## Overview
Categorizing financial transactions manually can be a tedious and error-prone task. By leveraging the **Llama2** model, this project automates transaction categorization, allowing for faster and more accurate analysis of financial data. This application showcases how local LLMs can be adapted for real-world tasks like data labeling.
